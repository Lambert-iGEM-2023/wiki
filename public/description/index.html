<h1 id="abstract">Abstract</h1>
<p>Statistically, every 33 seconds one person dies in the United States due to cardiovascular disease. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common cardiovascular disease, killing 375,476 people in 2021. With better diagnosis affordability and less invasive procedures, a large portion of these deaths could be prevented. To combat these barriers and increase the inclusivity of diagnosis available to people, Lambert iGEM utilizes microRNA (miRNA) as a biomarker to create a novel screening tool for CAD that also measures disease progression. To improve the sensitivity on last year’s design, Lambert iGEM has switched from standard rolling circle amplification (RCA) to exponential RCA. Lambert iGEM also utilized a process called protein purification to create lab-made phi29, an expensive protein required to run an RCA reaction. Lambert iGEM designed and constructed a liquid handler called LabPilot for accurate and automatic pipetting, and also refined last year’s microQ, a handheld and 3D printed fluorometer. To provide the synthetic biology community with more information about miRNAs and CAD, an online database called CADmir was developed. Lambert iGEM kept in contact with The American Heart association, Georgia Office of Cardiac Health, Red Cross, patients, doctors, and researchers to increase inclusivity and gain feedback for the project. Lambert iGEM improved CADlock in hopes of increasing inclusivity for all demographics while also providing a more accessible point of care screening tool along with an addition to miRNA research.</p>
<h1 id="defining-the-problem">Defining the Problem</h1>
<p>What is CAD, why CAD- CAD also known as Coronary artery disease ranks currently as the third highest problem of mortality worldwide and holds the foremost cause of deaths in the United States. Specifically within the U.S, the problem is more primary in the Southeastern region, and which encompasses our home of Georgia.
Symptoms of CAD- Coronary artery disease (CAD) can be displayed through a wide range of symptoms, some varying more of their visbility than others. Gender plays a significant role in symptom presentation, where women will typically enocunter their symptoms 7 to 10 years later than men. The following list below is not comprehensive, it displays various common symptoms that are linked to CAD. Chest pain, Nausea or any stomach weakness, weakness throughout your whole body, or shortness of breath.
Detection methods of CAD- There are multiple diagonistcs avaiable to the patients that are used by physicians to diagonse Coronary artery disease. Detection methods- Nucelar cardiology tests, electrocardiogram, heart functions stress tests, or a calcium score ( A special type of CT scan)
Pathophysiology- The development of the atheroscleortisis subseqeutnly narrows off the artierties, therefore leading to coronary artery disease or (CAD). CAD occurs thorugh a series of step processes. Below is the general overview of some of the processes that are involved.</p>
<ol>
<li>Formation- The first stages of atherosclerosis includes the deposition of foam cells also known as lipid macrophages. They disrupt the tunica intima, which is the innermost layer of the artery. Because of this disruption, it leads to the formation of a “fatty streak”.</li>
<li>Progression- LDL particles also known as low-density lipoprotein particles activate T cells, with the help of foam cells. This ultimately leads to immune responses that promote the nourishment of the plaque, and makes it increase in size. This whole process is called angiogenesis.</li>
<li>Blockage- As the atheroscleoric plaque persistently continues to grow in size, it undergoes calcification. Calcification also known as atherostenosis leads to the narrowing of the coronary arteries throughout the heart. Because of this restriction of the coronary arteries, it leads to blood flow undergoing restriction. If the occlusion in the arterites reach up to 100%, then it leads to myocardial infarction also known as a heart attack.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="micro-rna--2022-project">Micro RNA / 2022 project</h1>
<h2 id="barriers">Barriers</h2>
<p>The current barriers regarding care and prevention for Coronary Artery Disease are primarily centered around its high cost, and lack of accuracy. When looking at Lambert iGEM’s barriers specifically the 2022 projects, the team’s main concerns were lack of accuracy in padlock probes and miRNAs, and lack of performance from the aptimers. To address the concerns above, Lambert iGEM has engineered and built upon the following propositions: capillary tube, MircoQ, and exponential RCA.
Regarding the Capillary Tube, Lambert iGEM is centering its goal around improving the point of care and accessibility aspects of the 2022 project. To do so, the team is lowering the reaction time, and negating the need for a fluorometer for detection of microRNAs for Coronary Artery Disease.
MircoQ is focused around a similar objective. In 2022, MicroQ faced limitations of being able to only detect one type of fluorescent material, thus requiring complex assembling and disassembling. Therefore, Lambert iGEM developed [name], a device capable of multiplexing and choosing excitation wavelengths using a concave mirror, a white light LED, and a choice of emission filters.
Lambert iGEM’s new and improved exponential RCA wet lab model is primarily centered around the concept of accuracy. Although RCA has shown to be highly sensitive to the target mirnas, it lacks the ability to differentiate between various concentrations of mirna. To address this, the Lambert iGEM team is pursuing exponential RCA (erca), an adaptation of the rolling circle amplification model hat produces exponentially greater fluorescence per unit of mirna, therefore increasing between mirna concentration and margin of error.
Essentially, current diagnostic tools for Coronary Artery Disease are often unaffordable and invasive. To mitigate this, Lambert iGEM 2023 is further emphasizing the importance of inclusivityby pursuing a more accurate sensing mechanism and broadening the scope of accessibility.</p>
<h2 id="our-approach">Our Approach</h2>
<p>This year, Lambert iGEM has undertaken a new approach, with inclusivity being a primary area of focus for the project. Lambert iGEM seeks to take the underlying ideas of accuracy, affordability, and accessibility, and tie it into the overarching idea of inclusivity, making the products of Lambert iGEM’s 2023 project high quality, and easily available to all regardless of sex, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status.
To address this initiative, Lambert iGEM has implemented several tactics, including but not limited to, a STEM inclusivity podcast, a “Science for all Symposium”, a sex inclusivity wet lab initiative, a cost-effective MicroQ hardware device, exponential RCA (erca) , a new and improved version of the2022 Rolling Circle Amplification (RCA) model, a Coronary Artery Disease miRNA database, and several new hardware devices.
In order to implement this goal, Lambert iGEM has talked to multiple researchers and cardiology experts that aided the team in several portions of the project. For example, Lambert iGEMs sex inclusivity initiative regarding estrogen and its role in the increased susceptibility for Coronary Artery Disease was greatly enhanced through continued conversation with a leader of a women’s Cardiology center, with her assisting the team with microRNA research, and providing the members with supporting research as well.
With CADLOCK Phase 2, Lambert iGEM builds upon the 2022 Coronary Artery Disease project, with the creation of an improved wet lab approach, new and improved frugal hardware devices, and a holistically inclusive approach to all in the form of accuracy, affordability, and accessibility.</p>

<p>Buildup: Subendothelial deposits of foam cells (lipid macrophages) break the tunica intima - the innermost layer of the heart, forming a “fatty streak” (Shahjehan &amp; Bhutta, 2022).
Development: Low-density lipoprotein particles and foam cells activate T cells, which result in immune responses that nourish the plaque, making it increase in size, a process called angiogenesis (Baixeras et al., 2014).
Blockage: The atheroscleoric plaque continues to increase in size, calcifying over time and narrowing the heart artery in a process called atherostenosis (Baixeras et al., 2014). This process causes occlusion in the coronary arteries, reducing vital blood supply to the heart (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2020). A 100% occlusion in arteries results in death of heart tissue, ischemia, leading to a myocardial infarction (heart attack) (Shahjehan &amp; Bhutta, 2022).</p>

<p>Symptoms
Coronary artery disease (CAD) can be identified by a variety of common symptoms, some more obvious than others (Center for Disease Prevention [CDC], 2020), of which are usually presented differently by gender, with women often presenting symptoms 7 to 10 years later than men (see Fig. 3) (Maas &amp; Appelman, 2010). These symptoms include but are not limited to: Angina ( chest pain with pressure or tightness, usually a brief, stabbing pain.), Shortness of breath ( Intense tightening in chest with difficulty breathing and breathlessness.) Fatigue (Increased tiredness, the heart can’t pump blood to meet body’s needs.), and Nausea (Increased lightheadedness accompanied with dizziness and cold sweats).</p>

<h2 id="mirna-research-and-padlocks">Mirna research and padlocks</h2>
<p>miRNAs, small RNA molecules that do not encode proteins, have a regulatory role in gene expression by repressing translation or cleaving target mRNA molecules. These miRNAs are typically transcribed from DNA sequences and undergo stages of primary, precursor, and mature forms (O’Brien et al., 2018). Interacting with the 3’UTR region of mRNA, miRNAs can inhibit translation or trigger deadenylation/decapping processes, rendering the mRNA susceptible to degradation and influencing gene expression (see Fig. 5) (O’Brien et al., 2018).</p>
<p>Altered miRNA expression is frequently observed in various diseases, including cardiovascular conditions like coronary artery disease (CAD). Leveraging miRNAs as biosensors for CAD introduces an innovative approach with the potential to enhance CAD diagnosis and management. Profiling miRNAs can facilitate early detection of CAD, even before any cardiovascular event occurs, during the asymptomatic phase of the disease (Kaur et al., 2020). Presently, CAD diagnosis relies primarily on clinical methods, making it challenging to predict prognosis or evaluate the risk of future cardiac events. Moreover, patients with symptoms like angina pectoris or myocardial infarction often experience misdiagnosis due to the nonspecific nature of their symptoms. In this context, miRNA profiling proves valuable as an effective tool for uncovering concealed pathologies.</p>
<h3 id="cad-mirna-selection">CAD miRNA Selection</h3>
<p>After conducting an extensive literature review, we have chosen to develop biosensors that target hsa-miR-1-3p and hsa-miR-133-3p as biomarkers for screening and monitoring coronary artery disease. Notably, these two biomarkers exhibit upregulation in CAD patients (refer to Fig. 6) (Xiao et al., 2019). We intentionally avoided downregulated miRNAs to ensure the sensors have the ability to accurately detect these low concentrations of miRNAs.</p>
<p>hsa-miR-1-3p: This specific miRNA is associated with Gene Ontologies GO:0010460 and GO:0010614, which regulate the growth (hypertrophy) of cardiac muscle (miRBase).</p>
<p>hsa-miR-133a-3p: This miRNA is associated with Gene Ontologies GO:0010989 and GO:0010614, which are linked to the negative regulation of lipoproteins, an important factor in plaque formation. Additionally, miR-133a-3p plays a significant role in promoting cardiomyocyte proliferation.</p>
