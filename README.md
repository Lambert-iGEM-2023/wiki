# Lambert iGEM 2023 Wiki

Welcome to the Lambert iGEM 2023 Wiki! If you're not a member of the wiki committee, all edits should be made from the wiki editor. A few important things to note though:

- when using `href` or any links, the path to any links should be in the format of `lambert-ga/page`. Including `lambert-ga` is essential for links to work properly.
