# Human Practices

## Overview

Lambert iGEMâ€™s 2023 project, [CADlock](text.com), was shaped by the expertise of stakeholders during every step of its development. Inspired by the devastating impacts of coronary artery disease (CAD) and the growing research about microRNA (miRNA) biomarkers, we developed biosensors that can detect miRNA biomarkers correlated with CAD. In addition, we developed Micro-Q, a frugal fluorometer that quantifies fluorescence output from our biosensors. Throughout our project, we looked for ways to increase the accessibility of CAD diagnosis and expand the goals of healthy living to many different groups of people.
